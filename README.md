# react-templates

Light weight templates for react. Reasons that we love it:

* No runtime libraries. No magic. Just simple pre-compilation to a clear code
* Super easy to write panels. By panels we mean components that have a lot of HTML code and non-reusable logic
* Very good separation of presentation and logic. Almost no HTML within the component file
* Declerative coding for presentation. HTML that you write and inspect look similar
* Easy syntax. Similar to HTML. All IDEs recognize this format

## How does it work
React templates compiles a *.rt file (react template - extended HTML format) into a javascript file. Currently, this file supports requirejs format, that will return a function. This function, when applied, will return a virtual react DOM (based on React.DOM elements and user custom components). A common use case would be that a React component would require a JS file generated by a template, and then call ``func.apply(this)``, causing the template to have the component as its context.

###### Basic concepts for react templates:
* Any valid HTML is a template (and comments)
* {} to identify JS expression
* rt-if
* rt-repeat
* rt-scope
* rt-class
* style
* event handlers
* doctype rt, require dependencies, and calling other components

###### Why not use JSX?
Some love jsx, some don't. We don't. Well, not that we don't like it, but it seems to fit only components with very little html inside, which could be done by creating elements in code. Also, we like to separate code and html. It just feels right.

## Any valid HTML is a template
Writing any html is a valid template. This does not apply to event handlers ("on" methods). See the section about event handlers

## {} to identify JS expression
In html attributes and text, you can replace context by a javascript expression. You do this by wrapping it in {}. If this is inside an attribute, it still needs to be wrapped by quotes. In text, you can just use it.

Sample:
```
<a href="{this.state.linkRef}">{this.state.linkText}</a>
```
Compiled:
```
define([
    'react',
    'lodash'
], function (React, _) {
    'use strict';
    return function () {
        return React.DOM.a({ 'href': this.state.linkRef }, this.state.linkText);
    };
});
```
