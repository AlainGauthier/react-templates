react-templates
===============

Light weight templates for react. Reasons that we love it:

* No runtime libraries. No magic. Just simple pre-compilation to a clear code
* Super easy to write panels. By panels we mean components that have a lot of HTML code and non-reusable logic
* Very good separation of presentation and logic. Almost no HTML within the component file
* Declerative coding for presentation. HTML that you write and inspect look similar
* Easy syntax. Similar to HTML. All IDEs recognize this format

How does it work
----------------
React templates compiles a *.rt file (react template - extended HTML format) into a javascript file. Currently, this file supports requirejs format, that will return a function. This function, when applied, will return a virtual react DOM (based on React.DOM elements and user custom components). A common use case would be that a React component would require a JS file generated by a template, and then call func.apply(this), causing the template to have the component as its context.

**Basic concepts for react templates:**
* Any valid HTML is a template (and comments)
* {} to identify JS execution context
* rt-if
* rt-repeat
* rt-scope
* rt-class
* style
* event handlers
* doctype rt, require dependencies, and calling other components
